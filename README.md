Dual 24V 50A Brushed DC Motor Controller

This project aims to create an ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) for brushed DC motors wits high power demands. For this purpose an h-bridge and a microcontroller based control board.

A very detailed project that aims to build a 24V 40A brushed DC motor speed controller by Eric Brouwer can be found at https://goo.gl/TH2lnP on Instructables.
